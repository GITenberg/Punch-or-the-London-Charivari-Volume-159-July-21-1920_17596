<p>It is difficult to know whom or what to blame for the exceptionally wet
weather we have been having, says an evening paper. Pending a denial
from Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span>, <i>The Times</i> has its own opinion as to
who is at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanton</span> pointed out in the House of Commons that, unless

<p>"Danger of infection from Treasury notes," says <i>The Weekly Dispatch</i>,

<h3>THE GRASSHOPPER.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
The Animal Kingdom may be divided into creatures which one can feed and
creatures which one cannot feed. Animals which one cannot feed are
nearly always unsatisfactory; and the grasshopper is no exception.
Anyone who has tried feeding a grasshopper will agree with me.</p>

<p>Yet he is one of the most interesting of British creatures. <i>The
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> is as terse and simple as ever about him.
"Grasshoppers," it says, "are specially remarkable for their saltatory
powers, due to the great development of the hind legs; and also for
their stridulation, which is not always an attribute of the male only."
To translate, grasshoppers have a habit of hopping ("saltatory powers")
and chirping ("stridulation").</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed that the grasshopper stridulates by rubbing his
back legs together; but this is not the case. For one thing I have tried
it myself and failed to make any kind of noise; and for another, after
exhaustive observations, I have established the fact that, though he
does move his back legs every time he stridulates, <i>his back legs do not
touch each other</i>. Now it is a law of friction that you cannot have
friction between two back legs if the back legs are not touching; in
other words the grasshopper does not rub his back legs together to
produce stridulation, or, to put it quite shortly, he does not rub his
back legs together <i>at all</i>. I hope I have made this point quite clear.
If not, a more detailed treatment will be found in the Paper which I
read to the Royal Society in 1912.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I have always felt that there was something fishy about the
grasshopper's back legs. I mean, why <i>should</i> he wave his back legs
about when he is stridulating? My own theory is that it is purely due to
the nervous excitement produced by the act of singing. The same
phenomenon can be observed in many singers and public speakers. I do not
think myself that we need seek for a more elaborate hypothesis. <i>The
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, of course, says that "the stridulation or song
in the <i>Acridiid&aelig;</i> is produced by friction of the hind legs against
portions of the wings or wing-covers," but that is just the sort of
statement which the scientific man thinks he can pass off on the public
with impunity. Considering that stridulation takes place about every ten
seconds, I calculate that the grasshopper must require a new set of
wings every ten days. It would be more in keeping with the traditions of
our public life if the scientific man simply confessed that he was
baffled by this problem of the grasshopper's back legs. Yet, as I have
said, if a public speaker may fidget with his back legs while he is
stridulating, why not a public grasshopper? The more I see of science
the more it strikes me as one large mystification.</p>

<p>But I ought to have mentioned that "the <i>Acridiid&aelig;</i> have the auditory
organs on the first abdominal segment," while "the <i>Locustid&aelig;</i> have the
auditory organ on the <i>tibia</i> of the first leg." In other words one kind
of grasshopper hears with its stomach and the other kind listens with
its leg. When a scientific man has committed himself to that kind of
statement he would hardly have qualms about a little invention like the
back-legs legend.</p>

<p>With this scientific preliminary we now come to the really intriguing
part of our subject, and that is the place of the grasshopper in modern
politics. And the first question is, Why did Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span>
call Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> a grasshopper? I think it was in a speech
about Russia that Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span> said, in terms, that Lord
<span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> was a grasshopper. And he didn't leave it at that.
He said that Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> was not only a grasshopper but a
something something grasshopper, grasshopping here and grasshopping
there&mdash;that sort of thing. There was nothing much in the accusation, of
course, and Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> made no reply at the time; in
fact, so far as I know, he has never publicly stated that he is <i>not</i> a
grasshopper; for all we know it may be true. But I know a man whose
wife's sister was in service at a place where there was a kitchen-maid
whose young man was once a gardener at Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe's</span>, and
this man told me&mdash;the first man, I mean&mdash;that Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span>
took it to heart terribly. No grasshoppers were allowed in the garden
from that day forth; no green that was at all like grasshopper-green was
tolerated in the house, and the gardener used to come upon his Lordship
muttering in the West Walk: "A grasshopper! He called me a
grasshopper&mdash;<span class="smcap">me</span>&mdash;a <span class="smcap">Grasshopper</span>!" The gardener said
that his Lordship used to finish up with, "<i>I</i>'ll teach him;" but that
is hardly the kind of thing a lord would say, and I don't believe it. In
fact I don't believe any of it. It is a stupid story.</p>

<p>But this crisis we keep having with France owing to Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd
George's</span> infamous conduct does make the story interesting. The
suggestion is, you see, that Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> lay low for a long
time, till everybody had forgotten about the grasshopper and Mr.
<span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span> thought that Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> had
forgotten about the grasshopper, and then, when Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd
George</span> was in a hole, Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> said, "<i>Now</i> we'll
see if I am a grasshopper or not," and started stridulating at high
speed about Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span>. A crude suggestion. But if it
were true it would mean that the grasshopper had become a figure of
national and international importance. It is wonderful to think that we
might stop being friends with France just because of a grasshopper; and,
if Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> arranged for a new Government to come in,
it might very well be called "The Grasshopper Government." That would
look fine in the margins of the history-books.</p>

<p>Yes, it is all very "dramatic." It is exciting to think of an English
lord nursing a grievance about a grasshopper for months and months,
seeing grasshoppers in every corner, dreaming about grasshoppers.... But
we must not waste time over the fantastic tale. We have not yet solved
our principal problem. Why did Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span> call him a
grasshopper&mdash;a modest friendly little grasshopper? Did he mean to
suggest that Lord <span class="smcap">Northcliffe</span> hears with his stomach or
stridulates with his back legs?</p>

<p>Why not an earwig, or a black-beetle, or a wood-louse, or a centipede?
There are lots of insects more offensive than the grasshopper, and
personally I would much rather be called a grasshopper than an earwig,
which gets into people's sponges and frightens them to death.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had been reading that nice passage in the Prophet
<span class="smcap">Nahum</span>: "Thy captains are as the great grasshoppers, which camp
in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away,
and their place is not known where they are." I do not know. But <i>The
Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> has a suggestive sentence: "All grasshoppers are vegetable
feeders and have an incomplete metamorphosis, so that <i>their destructive
powers are continuous from the moment of emergence from the egg until
death</i>."</p>

<h3>AT THE PLAY.</h3>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">French Leave.</span>"</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
The Mandarins of the Theatre, who are no wiser than other mandarins (on
the contrary), have been long repeating the formula that the public
won't look at a War play. If I'm not mistaken it will for many moons be
looking at <span class="smcap">Captain Reginald Berkeley's</span> <i>French Leave</i>. He
labels it a "light comedy." That's an understatement. It is, as a matter
of fact, a very skilful, uproarious and plausible farce, almost too
successful in that you can't hear one-third of the jokes because of the
laughter at the other two-thirds (and a little because of the indistinct
articulation of one or two of the players). Of course when I say
"plausible" I don't exactly mean that any Brigade Headquarters was run
on the sketchy lines of <i>General Archibald Root's</i>, or that the gallant
author or anybody else who was in the beastly thing ever thought of the
Great War as a devastating joke, but rather that if it be true, as has
been rumoured, that not all generals were miracles of wisdom and
forbearance; that British subalterns and privates sometimes put on the
mask of humour; that <i>Venus</i> did wander, as the observatories punctually
reported she did occasionally wander, into the orbit of <i>Mars</i>&mdash;then
<i>French Leave</i> is a piece of artistically justifiable selection. Its
absurdity seems the most natural thing in the world and its machinery
(rare virtue!) does not creak.</p>

<p><i>Rooty Tooty's</i> brigade then was resting&mdash;if in the circumstances you
can call it resting. The rather stodgy Brigade-Major's leave being due,
his wife has come over to Paris to wait for him. The leave being
cancelled (and you could see how desperately overworked Headquarters
was) there suddenly appears what purports to be a niece of the billet
landlady's, a <i>Mdlle. Juliette</i>, of the Paris stage, with a distinctly
coming-on disposition (and frock). The uxorious Brigade-Major, weakly
consenting to the deception, suffers the tortures of the damned by
reason of the gallantries of the precocious Staff-Captain and the
old-enough-to-know-better Brigadier. There is marching and
counter-marching of detached units in the small hours; arrival of the
Brigade Interpreter with Intelligence's reports; sorrowful conviction in
the Brigadier's mind that <i>Juliette</i> is <i>Olga&mdash;Olga Thingummy</i>, the
famous German spy. Confusions; explosions; solutions.</p>

<p>That's a dull account of a bright matter. The players were not, with the
exception of Miss <span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;e Kelly</span>, of the star class and (I don't
necessarily say therefore) were almost uniformly admirable. I suppose
the honours must go to Mr. <span class="smcap">M.R. Morand's</span> excellently studied
<i>Brigadier</i>&mdash;the most laughter-compelling performance I have seen on the
"legitimate" for some years. But the <i>Mess Corporal</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles
Groves</span>), the <i>Staff-Captain</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry Kendall</span>), the
<i>Brigade-Major</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Hylton Allen</span>), the <i>Interpreter</i> (Mr.
<span class="smcap">George de Warfaz</span>) and the <i>Mess Waiter</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur
Riscoe</span>)&mdash;all deserve mention in despatches. As for the "business"
it was positively inspired at times, as when the <i>Mess Corporal</i>
retrieved the red-hat (which the passionate <i>Brigade-Major</i> had kicked
in his jealous fury) with an address which would have done credit to the
admirable <span class="smcap">Grock</span>. Miss <span class="smcap">Ren&eacute;e Kelly</span> had her pretty and
effective moments, but somebody should ask her (no doubt in vain) to be
less tearful in the tearful and just a little less bright in the bright
parts&mdash;a little less fidgetty and fidgetting and out of key, in fact.</p>

<p>I should say in general that author and producer (Mr. <span class="smcap">Eille
Norwood</span>) would do well to watch the serious passages&mdash;always the
danger-points in farce. As nobody on our side of the footlights takes
these seriously the folk on the other side must substantially dilute the
seriousness. The tragically uttered, "O God!" at the end of the Second
Act ruined an otherwise excellent curtain. But I must not end on a note
of censure. I was much too thoroughly entertained for that. Here's a
quite first-rate piece of fooling, with dialogue of humorous rather than
smart sayings. And humour's a much rarer and less cheap a gift than
smartness.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Are we going to the Dogs?</span></h4>

<p><i>By Vice-Admiral (Retd.) Sir Boniface Bludger, K.C.B</i>.</p>

<p>I was standing the other day at the window of the only Club in London
where they understand (or used to understand) what devilled kidneys
really are, musing in post-prandial gloom on the vanished glories of
this England of ours. "<i>Ichabod!</i>" I cried aloud to the unheeding stream
of Piccadilly wayfarers; and echo answered, "<i>Bod</i>."</p>

<p>What is wrong with us? Or what is wrong with me? Are we actually going
to the dogs, or is it merely that the Club kidneys are going to the
devil? <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> or <i>Mrs. Gummidge</i>&mdash;which am I? Let the facts
attest and let posterity decide; thank Heaven I shall not be there to
hear the verdict.</p>

<p>After our half-baked victory over the Hun the popular watchword was
"Reconstruction." We have now enjoyed a year and more of this
"building-up" process, and the net result is that houses for those that
lack them are as scarce as iced soda-fountains in the Sahara.</p>

<p>In this work of restoration, we were told, our women voters and
legislators would play a leading part. What part are they in truth
playing? Their main object apparently is still further to embitter the
Drink question, although if they would only put a little more bitter
into our national beverage they might help to lubricate matters. Is it
not a significant fact that the slackness evidenced in every phase of
industry manifests itself at a time when it becomes more and more
difficult to get a decent drink? In this respect our progress is not so
much to the dogs as to the cats, who sneak along on the padded paws of
Prohibition.</p>

<p>The crazy conditions to be observed in the industrial world are well
matched by the state of anarchy that prevails in the sphere of the arts.
Take music, for example. I do not lay claim to more than a nodding
acquaintance with Euterpe, and at a classical concert, I am afraid, the
nodding character of the relation becomes especially marked. To me the
sweetest music in the world is the roar of a fifteen-inch gun on a day
when the visibility is good and plentiful. But I do know enough to be
able to say that the wild asses who with their jazz-bands "stamp o'er
our heads and will not let us sleep" (slightly to amend my old friend
<span class="smcap">FitzGerald</span>) are nothing less than musical Trotskys.</p>

<p>Music was once regarded as the staple nourishment of the tender passion,
and in my younger days the haunting strains of "The Blue Danube"
assisted many a budding love-affair to blossom. But these non-stop
stridencies of the modern ballroom, even if they left a man with breath
enough to propose, would effectually prevent the girl from catching the
drift of the avowal. You can't roar, "Will you be mine?" into a maiden's
ear as if you were conversing from the quarterdeck, and if you did she'd
only think you were ecstatically emulating the coloured gentleman in the
orchestra with the implements of torture and the misguided voice.</p>

<p>I will pass over in the silence of despair such other symptoms of
national decadence as zigzag painting, whirlpool poetry, cinema
star-gazing and the impossibility of procuring a self-respecting Stilton
(which assuredly is not "living at this hour"). Nor can I trust myself
to speak of the spirit of Bolshevism that seems to animate our so-called
Labour Party, though I comfort myself with the conviction that this
doctrine will not wash, any more than will its authors.</p>

<p>I will conclude these few reflections by drawing attention to the
manners of the modern girl, who is so busily engaged in kicking over the
traces that formerly kept her in her proper place. Nowadays flappers who
should still be in the schoolroom consider themselves called upon to
teach their grandmothers how to conduct their lives; and, to complete
the chaos, the grandmothers are eagerly lapping it up, and in the matter
of dress and deportment are even bettering the instruction. <i>Si
vieillesse savait!</i></p>

<p>Oh for a prophet's tongue to lash our visionless leaders into a
realisation of the rocks on to which we are drifting! We need the
scourge of a <span class="smcap">Savonarola</span>, but all we get is the boom of a
<span class="smcap">Bottomley</span>.</p>

<h3>CONVERTED CASTLES.</h3>

<p>Rural England, I learn, is rapidly changing hands&mdash;not for the first
time, by the way, but we cannot go into that just now. Excellent
treatises on feudal tenure, wapentake, the dissolution of the
monasteries and the enclosure of common lands may be picked up dirt
cheap at any second-hand bookshop in the Charing Cross Road with the
words "Presentation Copy" erased from the flyleaf by a special and
ingenious process. What is happening now is that farmers are buying up
the big estates in pieces, and Norman piles or Elizabethan manors are
beginning to be too expensive to maintain, what with coal and the rise
in the minimum wage of vassals and one thing and another.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"The stately homes of England</p>
<p class="i2">How beautiful they stood</p>
<p>Before their recent owners</p>
<p class="i2">Relinquished them for good,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>as the poet justly observes. And even if there is enough money to keep
up the castle without the broad acres (though as a matter of fact an
acre is not any broader than it is long) there is no fun in having a
castle at all when the deer park has been divided into allotments and
the Dutch garden is under swedes.</p>

<p>The question is then what is going to happen to Montmorency (pronounced
"Mumsie") Castle, and The Towers at Barley Melling?</p>

<p>In London the difficulty of dealing with huge houses has been solved in
a very subtle manner by turning them into a couple of maisonettes
apiece, so that under the portico of what used to be 105 Myrtle Crescent
you discover two perfectly good doors, marked 105<span class="smcap">a</span> and
105<span class="smcap">b</span>. Into the letter-box of the door marked 105<span class="smcap">a</span> the
postman invariably puts the letters intended for 105<span class="smcap">b</span>, and
<i>vice vers&aacute;</i>, but, as these are always letters addressed to the last
tenant but two, it does not really very much matter. Both are desirable
maisonettes, though the tenants of 105<span class="smcap">a</span> have the sole enjoyment
of the lincrusta dadoes in the original dining-room. In some cases there
are as many as three maisonettes, and the notice on the area gate says,
"105<span class="smcap">c</span>. <i>Mrs. Orlando Smith</i>," where it used to say simply
"<span class="smcap">No bottles</span>." I never really understood that notice myself, for
whenever I am walking along with an empty bottle that I want to get rid
of I do not throw it down into an area, where it would make a most
horrible crash, but softly into the thick shrubs of the Crescent
Gardens.</p>

<p>This brings me back to the country again.</p>

<p>There will not be enough of the new rich to purchase a castellated
mansion apiece, partly because of the Excess Profits Duty, which is
crippling this kind of enterprise, and partly because so many baronial
seats, romantic and picturesque in their way, are terribly
under-garaged. On the other hand you cannot expect a farmer who happens
to be buying the fields round Badgery Mortimer to have any use for a
dungeon keep or the haunted picture-gallery in the west wing. No, there
is only one thing to do and that is to break these places up into a
number of self-contained homes.</p>

<h3>HISTORIC FLATS TO LET</h3>

<p>is the house-agents' advertisement which I seem to see, and what you
will actually find will be a sort of concentrated hamlet where modern
improvements are mixed with ancient grandeur and the white-haired
seneschal is kept on to operate the electric lift.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, the case of Soping Hall. There will be none
of that untidy straggling arrangement about it which detracts so largely
from the beauty of Soping Barnet, Little Soping and Soping Monachorum.
In Soping Hall the billiard-room will be the village club, the armoury
the blacksmith's shop, the housekeeper's room the place where you buy
buttons and balls of string and barley-sugar, the cellars the village
tavern, and very nice too. In the state-saloon, with a few trifling
alterations, such as the introduction of a geyser and a sink, will live
Mrs. Ponsonby-Smith, who will sniff a little at the Jeffries in their
attic suite and the Mutts who live in the moat. But Mrs. Jeffries will
have compensations, because the air is really so much more bracing, my
dear, on the higher ground, and on fine days one can walk about the roof
and peep through the boiling-oil holes, while as for the Mutts they are
protected, at any rate, from those bitterly piercing east winds and have
an excellent view of the draw-bridge.</p>

<p>A further advantage of residing at Soping Hall will be that you can do
all your shopping and pay your calls without going out-of-doors on a wet
day, and, if you like, have a communal dining-room or restaurant, where
only those who have been recognised by the county should sit above the
salt. And if your friends come to visit you in expensive motor-cars they
will have the privilege of passing through the great iron gates on the
main road and up the large gravel drive planted on each side with the
cedars of Lebanon which Roger de Soping brought back in his haversack
from the Second Crusade.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that when federal devolution becomes really infectious
and every county insists on a legislative assembly of its own it may be
necessary to turn some of these great houses into Parliament chambers,
and the rural civil service will also no doubt insist on having offices
comparable with the vast hotels which their parent bodies occupy in
London. But this will not account for nearly all the ancestral seats,
and, in calling the attention of the Minister of Health and Housing to
this little memorandum of mine, I would specially urge him to note how
it will solve some of the most difficult problems which confront him
to-day.</p>

<p>There will be a rush upon these potted villages, and that will ease the
situation in towns and free a number of cottages for agricultural
labourers too. There will be a rush, not only because of the advantages
which I have already enumerated, but because all the people who live in
Soping Hall will be able to put "Soping Hall" on their notepaper, and,
if they like to pay for it, two <i>wyverns rampant</i> as well, and everyone
outside the circle of their immediate friends will imagine that they
have not only bought the whole place but even become the possessors of
the flock of wyverns that used to be pastured on the Home Farm.</p>

<p>Three acres and a cow was all very well in its way, but what about two
wyverns and a flat? <span class="smcap">Evoe.</span></p>

<h3>TIPS FOR UNCLES.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I am writing to
you about uncles because you
are in a way a kind of general uncle. Uncles are much more useful than
aunts, because uncles always give money and aunts mostly give advice.
Only, as the Head always says when he jaws our form, "I regret to see in
this form a serious deterioration"&mdash;I mean in uncles. They come down
here and trot us round and say what a luxurious place it is compared
with the stern old Spartan days. They know something, though. They ask
us to have meals with them at an hotel. They take care not to face a
luxurious house-dinner. And while we dine they tell yarns about the
hardness of the old days and how it toughened a fellow. And then,
because about 1870 it was the custom to tip a boy five bob, they fork
out five bob and tell you not to waste it.</p>

<p>If the Head had any sense&mdash;only you can't expect sense from Heads&mdash;he'd
put up a notice at the school gates: "Parents, Uncles and Friends are
respectfully reminded that the cost of tuck has increased three hundred
per cent. since 1914." Why, old Badham, my bedroom prefect, who was a
fag in 1914, turned up the other day and declared that then he could buy
four pounds of strawberries for a bob, and that a fag could get enough
chocolate for two bob to give him a week in the sick-room.</p>

<p>Yet we have uncles coming down in trains (fare fifty per cent. extra),
smoking cigars (costing two hundred per cent. extra), cabbing it up to
school (a hundred-and-fifty per cent. extra) and then tipping as if the
old <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> was still swanking in Potsdam.</p>

<p>Now Sutton minor, who has a positive beast of a house-master and is
practically a Bolshevist, says that we ought to go on strike against the
tipping system and demand a regular living wage from relations. He says
that if a scavenger gets four quid a week a fellow who has to tackle
Greek aorists ought to get eight quid a week.</p>

<p>But I'm afraid a strike might aggravate uncles. It's no use upsetting
the goose that lays the silver eggs, so I thought it better to write to
you, pointing out that there was one luxury still at pre-war prices and
that uncles should never miss a chance of indulging in it, and whenever
high prices bothered them they should write us a bright cheerful letter
enclosing a postal order&mdash;they're still quite cheap.</p>

<p>Chalmers major, who has read this and leads a sad life, having only
aunts, says that the only hope for him is in fixing a standard tip of
9<i>s.</i> 11&frac34;<i>d.</i> or, better still, 19<i>s.</i> 11&frac34;<i>d.</i>, that women
couldn't help giving.</p>

<p>So hoping that all uncles will put their hands to the plough&mdash;I mean in
their pockets&mdash;and then the bitter cry of the New Poor will cease in our
public schools,</p>

<p>Yours respectfully, <span class="smcap">Bruce Tertius</span>.</p>

<h3>THE STATE AND THE SCREEN.</h3>

<p>(<i>By a Student of Film Politics.</i>)</p>

<p>Great satisfaction has been evinced in film circles over the conferment
of a signal honour on Signor <span class="smcap">Pavanelli</span>, the outstanding Italian
screen luminary. The rank of Chevalier of the Crown of Italy is
equivalent to a knighthood in this country, and <span class="smcap">Pavanelli</span>'s
elevation is a gratifying proof of the paramount position which the
cinema is assuming in Italian national affairs. But gratification is
sadly tempered by the deplorable lack of State recognition from which
film-artists suffer in this country. The joint co-starring Sovereigns of
the Screen, though acclaimed by the populace with an enthusiasm
unparalleled in the annals of adoration, were allowed to depart from our
shores without a single official acknowledgment of their services to
humanity. No vote of congratulation was passed by the Houses of
Parliament; no honorary degree was conferred on them by any University;
no ode of welcome was forthcoming from the pen of the <span class="smcap">Poet
Laureate</span>.</p>

<p>The discontent caused by the indifference of the Government to the
wishes of the people is fraught with formidable possibilities. Already
there are serious rumours of the summoning of a Special Trade Union
Congress to discuss the desirability of direct action as a means of
compelling the Government to abandon their attitude of hostility to the
only form of monarchy which the working-classes can conscientiously
support. It is further reported that Lieutenant-Commander
<span class="smcap">Kenworthy</span>, M.P., will seize the first opportunity to move the
impeachment of Dr. <span class="smcap">Bridges</span>. The indignation in Printing House
Square has reached boiling-point, and it is reported that the
authorities are only awaiting the delivery of a huge consignment of
small pica type to launch a fresh and final onslaught on the Coalition.</p>

<h4>BAD FOR THE BULL.</h4>

<p>The provocation has undoubtedly been intense. It was proved in an
article of studied moderation and exquisite taste that the time had come
to revise our estimates of bygone grandeur and substitute for the
devotion to a Queen of tarnished fame and disastrous tendencies the
spontaneous and chivalrous worship of her beneficent and prosperous
namesake. Yet in spite of this dignified and convincing appeal no
invitation was sent to the one person whose presence at the recent
proceedings at Holyrood would have lent them a crowning lustre. The
action or inaction of the <span class="smcap">Lord Chamberlain</span> is inexplicable,
except on the assumption that Queen Pickford's engagement to attend the
Spa Conference would have rendered it impossible for her to accept the
invitation to Edinburgh. None the less the invitation should have been
sent. Besides, the resources of aviation might have surmounted the
difficulty. In any case this deplorable oversight has knocked one more
nail in the coffin of the <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span>.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p><i>Monday, July 12th.</i>&mdash;Viscount <span class="smcap">Curzon</span>'s complaint about
"crawling" taxi-cabs was ostensibly based upon the obstruction thus
caused to more rapidly moving traffic. But I fancy that it was really
due to an inherent belief that the motor-car is a noble creature, only
happy when exceeding the speed-limit and dashing through
police-controls, and that to compel the poor thing to crawl is "agin
natur'" and ought to be dealt with by the R.S.P.C.A.</p>

<p>As usual much of Question-time was devoted to Russian affairs. Colonel
<span class="smcap">Wedgwood</span> wanted to know whether the Cabinet had approved a
message from Mr. <span class="smcap">Churchill</span> to the late Admiral
<span class="smcap">Kolchak</span>, advising him how to commend his Administration to the
<span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span>, who was described in the telegram as
"all-powerful, a convinced democrat and particularly devoted to advanced
views on the land question." Mr. <span class="smcap">Law</span>, while provisionally
promising a Blue-book on Siberia, declined to pick out a single message
from a whole bunch.</p>

<p>The news that the Soviet Government had accepted the British conditions
with regard to the resumption of trade and had thereupon been requested
to conclude an armistice with Poland did not seem particularly welcome
to any section of the House. Those whom Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanton</span> in
stentorian whispers daily describes as the "Bolshies" evidently feared
that the request had been accompanied by a threat, while others were
horrified at the idea of recognising the present <i>r&eacute;gime</i> in Russia, and
drew from Mr. <span class="smcap">Law</span> a hasty disclaimer. The House as a whole
would, I think, have liked to learn how you can do business with a
person whom you do not recognise?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> refused to accept Mr.
<span class="smcap">George Terrell</span>'s proposal to reduce the Excess Profits Tax from
sixty per cent. to forty, but, in reply to Sir <span class="smcap">G. Younger</span>&mdash;who
"has such a way wid him"&mdash;promised that next year he would make the
reduction. He admitted that it was in many ways an unsatisfactory tax,
but the Government could not afford to part with it unless a substitute
was provided. Somebody suggested "Economy," and Sir <span class="smcap">F. Banbury</span>
proved to his own satisfaction that the present estimates could be
reduced by a hundred-and-fifty millions. But unexpected support for the
Government came from Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span>, who as the original sponsor
of the tax felt it his duty to support it.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">To
produce a saving of one hundred-and-fifty millions you merely have to
hold the hat firmly in the left hand&mdash;thus.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>There was a perfect E.P.D.mic of criticism, but it was brilliantly
countered by Mr. <span class="smcap">Baldwin</span>, who declared that the
<span class="smcap">Chancellor</span>, far from leading the country down the rapids, "was
the one man who had seized a rock in m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[pg 50]</span>id-stream and was hanging on to it
with hands and feet." The Amendment was rejected by 289 to 117, and the
clause as a whole was passed by 202 to 16.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, July 13th.</i>&mdash;Lord <span class="smcap">O'Hagan</span> was one of the Peers who
helped to outvote the Government a few days ago on a motion excusing
them of extravagance. Yet that did not prevent him to-day from saying
that the War Office should be more generous in their financial treatment
of the Territorial Force, and particularly of the Cadet Corps. Naturally
Lord <span class="smcap">Peel</span> did not refrain from calling attention to this
inconsistency&mdash;common to most of the financial critics of the
Administration&mdash;but nevertheless he made a reply indicating that the
grants for the Territorial Force were being revised, presumably in an
upward direction, since Lord <span class="smcap">O'Hagan</span> expressed himself
grateful.</p>

<p>The Commons, like the Lords, are all for economy collectively, if not
individually. General cheers greeted Mr. <span class="smcap">Bonar Law</span>'s
announcement that all war-subsidies&mdash;save that on wheat&mdash;were to be
brought to an end as soon as possible, but then there were similar
cheers for those Members who urged the substitution of ex-service men
for the less highly-paid women in various Public Departments.</p>

<p>The House enjoyed the unusual experience of hearing from
Lieut.-Commander <span class="smcap">Kenworthy</span> an apology&mdash;and a very handsome one
too&mdash;for something that he had said in debate about Colonel
<span class="smcap">Croft</span>. It was accompanied by a tribute to his military
efficiency which made that gallant warrior blush. It only now remains
for the Leader of the National Party to reciprocate by rescuing from the
Naval archives some equally complimentary reference to the services of
Lieut.-Commander <span class="smcap">Kenworthy</span>.</p>

<p>A new sport has been invented by Colonel <span class="smcap">Guinness</span>. It consists
in sending two telegrams simultaneously to Paris, one <i>vi&acirc;</i> London and
the other <i>vi&acirc;</i> New York, and seeing which gets there first. At present
New York wins by twenty minutes. Mr. <span class="smcap">Illingworth</span> excused
himself from giving an immediate explanation on the ground that he had
not had time to check the facts. No doubt he hopes that in the interim
other Members will follow Colonel <span class="smcap">Guinness</span>'s example and, by
joining in the new pastime, bring grist to the Post-Office mill.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, July 14th.</i>&mdash;Lord <span class="smcap">Milner</span> must have thought he was
back in the era of "Chinese Slavery" when he found himself assailed on
all sides because the Chief Native Commissioner in Kenya Colony (late
British East Africa) had issued a circular instructing the chiefs to
influence their followers in the direction of honest toil. Lord
<span class="smcap">Islington</span> described this as "perilously near forced labour;"
His Grace of <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span> facetiously suggested that the chiefs'
idea of influence would be the sjambok; and Lord <span class="smcap">Emmott</span> talked
of "Prussianism."</p>

<p>Taught by past experience Lord <span class="smcap">Milner</span> did not make light of the
accusations, but set himself to show how little real substance they
contained. The Chief Native Commissioner was "not a Prussian"; on the
contrary the local white population thought him too great an upholder of
native privileges. But he was very keen on getting the black man to
work, and had therefore issued this circular, which was open to
misinterpretation. An explanatory document would be issued shortly.</p>

<p>Echoes of the <span class="smcap">Dyer</span> debate are still reverberating through the
Commons, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Montagu</span> was put through a searching
cross-examination regarding his relations with Mr. <span class="smcap">Gandhi</span>.
Apparently that gentleman has a very simple plan of campaign. He
agitates more and more dangerously until he is threatened with
prosecution. Then he says "Sorry!" and Mr. <span class="smcap">Montagu</span> begs him
off. After a brief interval of quiescence he starts again. Just now he
is once more nearing the imaginary line that separates proper from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[pg 51]</span>

<p>The House was delighted to see Mr. <span class="smcap">Devlin</span> and Mr.
<span class="smcap">MacVeagh</span> back in their places. A little honest Irish
obstruction would be a refreshing change after the feeble imitations of
the Kenworthies and Wedgwoods. But the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> could not accept
the proposition that a speech delivered three weeks ago, in which an
Irish official was alleged to have prophesied some dreadful things which
as a matter of fact had not happened, could be regarded as "a definite
matter of urgent public importance."</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span> was unable to get
back from Spa in order to assist in the final suppression of his famous
land-duties. Most of the speeches delivered were made up of excerpts
from his old orations of ten years ago&mdash;that almost prehistoric era
known as the Limehouse Period&mdash;and it would have been an object-lesson
in political gymnastics to see him explaining himself away.</p>

<p>The land-taxers made a gallant effort to frighten their opponents away
by chanting the "Land Song" in the Lobby, but it is supposed that the
Government supporters had copied Ulysses' method with the Sirens, for
enough of them remained faithful to defeat the land-taxers by 190 to 68.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, July 15th.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Neal</span>'s announcement that the
proposed increase in rail way fares had been postponed until August 5th,
in order not to spoil the Bank Holiday, was far from satisfying the
House. Mr. <span class="smcap">Clynes</span> pointed out that large numbers of the
working-classes now took their long holidays in August. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Palmer</span> was of opinion that the working-classes could pay well
enough; it was the middle-class that would suffer most; and Mr. <span class="smcap">R.
McNeill</span>, following up this assertion, suggested (without success)
that for the sake of poverty-stricken M.P.'s the House should adjourn
before the fateful date.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">H. Greenwood</span> gave particulars of the Sinn Fein raid on the
Dublin Post-Office, but declined to give an opinion as to whether there
had been any collusion with the staff inside. Judging by the promptitude
and efficiency of the raiders' procedure it seems highly improbable that
postal officials had anything to do with it.</p>

<h3>TWENTY YEARS ON.</h3>

<p>We were sitting in the verandah, Ernest and I. On the greensward before
us Ernest Junior and James Junior (I am James) disported themselves as
became their years, which were respectively 1&frac34; and 1 <span style="font-size: smaller">5</span>/<span style="font-size: smaller">8</span>. In the
middle distance, or as middle as the size of our lawn permits, might be
seen the mothers of Ernest Junior and James Junior deep in conversation,
discussing, perhaps, the military prowess of their lords, though I
rather fear I caught the word "jumper" every now and then.</p>

<p>A loud difference of opinion between James II. and Ernest II. as to the
possession of a wooden horse momentarily disturbed the peaceful scene.
It was left to Ernest and myself to settle it, our incomparable wives
being still completely engrossed with the subject of our military
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
prowess (or of jumpers). When quiet reigned once more Ernest said, "Have
you ever looked twenty years on?"</p>

<p>"Practically never," I answered. "It is too exhausting."</p>

<p>"It is exhausting, but with my usual energy I do it all the same," said
Ernest, who is as a fact the world's champion lotus-eater. "Last night I
was picturing a little scene in the year 1940. Shall I tell you of it?"
And without waiting for my assent he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The scene is laid in an undergraduate's rooms. Ernest Junior and James
Junior are discovered in <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i> attitudes and the conversation
proceeds something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Ernest Junior.</i> What are you going to do with yourself in the Vac.?</p>

<p>"<i>James Junior.</i> I shall go abroad, in spite of my choice of objectives
being so terribly restricted.</p>

<p>"<i>Ernest Junior.</i> Why restricted?</p>

<p>"<i>James Junior.</i> Well, I wouldn't say this to anybody else, but to tell
you the truth it is impossible for me to go to either France, Belgium or
Italy. You see my dear old father was in these countries during the
first Great War, and if I were so much as to mention them he'd never
stop talking. If I were to say that I proposed spending a fortnight in
the Ardennes it would let loose such a flood of reminiscence that I
should hardly get away before next term begins.</p>

<p>"He gets a little confused too at times. He told me the other day a long
story about the relief of Ypres, and he also boasted of having himself
captured a large number of Turks on the Somme.</p>

<p>"And it isn't only that. My mother was a V.A.D. in France, you know. And
when the old man had done talking of Ypres and the Somme she'd begin
about Rouen and Etaples."</p>

<p>I laughed, but without mirth, for I did not really think this at all
funny. And after all I might have said just the same about Ernest, if
only I'd thought of it first.</p>

<h3>POINTS OF VIEW.</h3>

<p>The manager had seen to it that the party of young men, being very
obviously rich, at any rate for this night, had some of the best
attendance in the restaurant. Several waiters had been told off
specially to look after them, the least and busiest of whom was little
more than a boy&mdash;a slender pale boy, who was working very hard to give
satisfaction. The cynic might think&mdash;and say, for cynics always say what
they think&mdash;that this zeal was the result of his youth; but the cynic
for once would be only partly right. The zeal also had sartorial
springs, this eventful day being the first on which the boy had been
promoted to full waiter-hood, and the first therefore on which he had
ever worn a suit of evening dress; which by dint of hard saving his
family had been able to obtain for him. Wearing a uniform of such
dignity and conscious that he was on the threshold of his career, he was
trying very hard to make good and hoping very fervently that he would
get through without any drops or splashes to impair the freshness of his
new and wonderful attire.</p>

<p>The party of young men, who had been at a very illustrious English
school together and now were either at a university or in the world,
were celebrating an annual event and were very merry about it. For the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
most part they had, between the past and the present, as many topics of
conversation as were needed, but now and then came a lull, during which
some of them would look around at the other tables, note the prettier of
the girls or the odder of the men and comment upon them; and it chanced
that in such a pause one of the diners happened for the first time to
notice with any attention the assiduous young waiter. Although not old
enough to have given any thought to the anomaly of youth (though lowly)
attending upon youth (though gilded) at its meals in this way&mdash;not old
enough indeed to have pondered at all upon the relations of Capital and
Labour or of the domineering and the servile&mdash;he had reflected a good
deal upon the cut and fit of clothes, and there was something about the
waiting-boy's evening coat that outraged his critical sense. Nor did the
fact that the other's indifferent tailoring throw the perfection of his
own into such brilliant contrast&mdash;the similarity between the livery of
service and the male costume <i>de luxe</i> fostering such comparisons&mdash;make
him any more lenient.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see," he asked his neighbour, "such a coat-collar as that
waiting Johnnie's? I ask you. How can anyone, even a waiter, wear a
thing like that? Don't they ever see themselves in the glass, or if they
do can't they see straight? Why, it covers his collar altogether."</p>

<p>His companion agreed. "And the shoulders! You'd have thought that in a
restaurant like this the management would be more particular. By George,
that's a jolly pretty girl coming in! Look&mdash;over there, just under the
clock, with the red hair." And the waiter was forgotten. Only, however,
by his table critics, for at that moment a little woman who had made
friends with the hall-porter for this express purpose was peering
through the window of the entrance, searching the room for her son. She
had never yet seen him at his work at all, and certainly not in his
grand waiting clothes, and naturally she wanted to.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said at last, pointing the boy out to the porter, "there he
is! At that table with all the young gentlemen. Doesn't he look fine?
And don't they fit him beautifully? Why, no one would know the
difference if he were to sit down and one of those young gentlemen were
to wait on him."</p>

<h3>PIGLETS.</h3>

<p>While waiting for proof-sheets of my book on <i>The Dynamic Force of
Modern Art</i> I thought I might get a certain amount of amusement out of a
little correspondence with my neighbour, Mr. Gibbs, small farmer and
dairyman, between whom and myself letters had passed a short time ago on
the subject of a noisy cow, since removed from the field below the study
window of the house that has been lent me by my friend Hobson. With this
end in view I wrote to Mr. Gibbs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Gibbs</span>,&mdash;The field of the uproarious cow has, I
notice, suddenly become tenanted again, this time by what appears to be
a school, herd or murrain of swine. Their number seems to vary.
Sometimes I count ten younglings, sometimes as many as thirteen, and
once I made it as much as fourteen.</p>

<p>Did you know they were there, or are they a crop? Or is the field
suffering from swine fever, of which they are the outward manifestation?
Anyhow, whether they are friends of yours or have merely just happened,
as it were, they are distinctly intriguing.</p>

<p>My wife was remarking to me only yesterday how nice some pork would be
as a change from the eternal verities, beef and mutton, and I told her
that if she would look out of my window she would see the pork running
about, simply asking for it. There are so many of these piglets that I
don't think the old sow would miss one. Swine can't count, can they?</p>

<p>But apart from food values they interest me as subjects for the Cubist,
the Vorticist and other exploiters of dynamic force in the Art of to-day
(I fancy I told you in a previous letter that I am engaged upon a tome
on this subject).</p>

<p>Figure to yourself, <i>mon ami</i>, what delightful rhomboidal figures
<span class="smcap">Wyndham Lewis</span> and his school would make of these budding
porkers with the sleek torso and the well-poised angular snout, and,
having visualised their treatment of the theme, compare it with the
painted effigies of such animals by <span class="smcap">George Morland</span>, which were
merely pigs, Sir, and nothing more. No symbolism, no force. You get
me&mdash;what?</p>

<p>But looking at these piglets from a more intimate point of view, don't
you think (if they should happen to be yours, and you have any influence
with their parents) that something should be done about their faces?
They have such a pushed-in appearance. Can this be normal? If so, it
must seriously interfere with their truffling. But perhaps this is not
good truffle-hunting country. I'm sorry if this is so, as I could do
with a nice brace of truffles now and again.</p>

<p>Remember me kindly to our mooing friend, and believe me, dear Mr. Gibbs,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />

</p>

<p>How this early touch of Spring has got into the blood, to be sure.</p>

<p>To this letter Mr. Gibbs replied thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir,</span>&mdash;i cant make much of your letter except a riglemerole
about pigs and dinamite and pictures but what they have to do with one
another i dont know if you want some pork why dont you say so strait out
like mr Hobson does i shall be killing one this week shall i send you a

<p>My reply, given in the affirmative, resulted in the arrival of a
succulent-looking joint with a bill for leg of pork special 5&frac12; lbs.
at 2<i>s.</i> per lb. 11<i>s.</i></p>

<p>As the price too was rather special I returned the bill with the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Gibbs,</span>&mdash;What a rapturous piece of pork! Lovely in
life, and oh, how beautiful in death. I count the hours till 7.30
to-morrow.</p>

<p>I am truly sorry you couldn't read my letter with comfort. I have
derived great pleasure from yours. You appear to have a strong leaning
towards phonetic orthography which is very refreshing and seems to bear
the same relation to the generally accepted rules of the art that the
modern dynamic art (a favourite topic of mine, as you know) does to the
academics of the late nineteenth century.</p>

<p>When the proof-sheets of my book arrive I should be glad of your
assistance in going through them. My tendency, I think, is to
over-punctuate, and your proclivity would, I believe, counteract this.</p>

<p><i>Mais revenons &agrave; nos moutons</i> (<i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of course). The
specialist who superintends my diet allows me to eat pork at 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
per lb., but does not approve of my indulgence in it at a higher figure.
If you will meet his views (and I am sure you will) I shall absorb my
full share of the dainty you have provided. Otherwise I must return it
with many exquisite regrets.</p>

<p>Anticipating your favourable recognition of my specialist's absurd
prejudice, I enclose a cheque for 9<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Accept my word for it that I am</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Yours ever most truly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Arthur K. Wilkinson.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>To this Mr. Gibbs offered the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deer Sir,</span>&mdash;i thought being a friend of mr Hobson you was a
gentleman as wouldn't mind paying a bit extra for something special like
this pork which these pigs was by Barnsley Champion III i cant charge
less. i dont know who your specialist is but he dont know much about
pork the bests the safest. please send ballance and remain</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yours obedient,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Henry Gibbs.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p>We were still in March and pork had not yet been decontrolled, so I
returned the bill again with this brief but incisive note:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Gibbs</span>,&mdash;I have never met your friend from Barnsley,
but am surprised that you haven't come across my specialist, whose
address is the Local Food Control Office at Harbury. Would you like to
meet him? He is very interested in pigs, also in milk and other things
in which you specialise expensively, so you would have lots to talk
about, no doubt.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Arthur K. Wilkinson</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The receipt in full, which reached me in reply, was very satisfactory.
The pork was delicious.</p>

<h3>NOCTURNE.</h3>

<p>Of course I suppose I ought to be grateful for the opportunity of having
a front seat at one of Nature's romances, but I imagine she reaps more
applause at matin&eacute;es than at soir&eacute;es. I know that I&mdash;But judge for
yourself.</p>

<p>The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> were corncrakes, neighbours of mine. The
heroine&mdash;a neat line in spring birdings&mdash;I labelled "Thisbe," and she
had evidently inspired affection of no mean degree in the hearts of two
enthusiastic swains, Strong-i'-th'-lung and Eug&egrave;ne. I know all this
because Thisbe's home is a small tuft of grass not distant from my
bedroom, and her admirers wooed her at long range from opposite corners
of my field.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[pg 56]</span></p>
<p>Now, as a cursory study of ornithology will tell you, the corncrake's
method of attracting his bride is by song, and the criterion of
excellence in C.C. circles is that the song shall be protracted,
consistent and perfectly monotonous. To those who are unacquainted with
his note I would describe it as rather similar to the intermittent
buzzing noise which an inexperienced telephone operator lets loose when
she can't think of a wrong number to give you. It has also points of
resemblance to the periodic thud of the valve of a motor-tube when one
is running on a deflated tyre. But there is no real standard of
comparison. As a musical feat it is unique, and I for one am glad it is.</p>

<p>It was night. Eug&egrave;ne was in possession of the stage when I began to take
an interest in the romance. I cannot say for how long he had serenaded
his divinity before I became conscious of his lay, but I do know that
thereafter he put in one and a half hours of good solid craking before
he desisted. I then felt grateful for the silence, rolled over and
prepared to get on with my postponed slumber.</p>

<p>But Strong-i'-th'-lung decreed otherwise. With a contemptuous snort at
his rival's performance he opened his epic. He was splendid. For one and
three-ninths hours he descanted on the glories of field life, on the
freshness of the night, on the brilliance of the June foliage; for the
next two hours he ardently proclaimed the surpassing beauty of Thisbe's
eye, the glossiness of her plumage, the neatness of her claw, and he
wound up with a mad twenty minutes of piercing monotony as he depicted
the depth of his devotion for her.</p>

<p>When he ceased, in a silence which was almost deafening, I could
visualise Thisbe dimpling with satisfaction and undoubtedly filled with
tenderness toward a lover capable of expressing himself so eloquently. I
turned over with a sigh of relief and closed my eyes in pleasurable
anticipation of rest.</p>

<p>But Eug&egrave;ne felt it necessary to reply. I think his intention was to
crake disbelief of his rival's sincerity, to throw cold water on his
burning professions, perhaps even to question the excellence of his
intentions. But his nerve was obviously shaken by his competitor's
undoubtedly fine performance, and he craked indecisively. At 4.30
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I distinctly heard him utter a flat note. At 4.47 he
missed the second part of a bar entirely. Thisbe's beak, I must believe,
curled derisively; Strong-i'-th'-lung laughed contemptuously, and at
5.10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Eug&egrave;ne faltered, stammered and fled from the field
defeated.</p>

<p>The sequel I have had to build up on rather fragmentary data, but it
appears that Eug&egrave;ne fled as far as Pudberry Parva, and endeavoured to
cool his discomfiture in a dewy hayfield.</p>

<p>To him there came an old crone, the "father and mother" of all
corncrakes, who comforted him, cossetted him, and from a fund of deep
experience offered him hints on voice production. She also gave him of a
nostrum of toadwort and garlic, which mollified his lacerated chords,
and she prescribed massage of the throat by rubbing against a young
beech stem.</p>

<p>Within two days Eug&egrave;ne was back in my field. In tones that feigned to
falter he craked a few bars to open the performance. Strong-i'-th'-lung
at once rose full of pitying confidence and craked for two and a half
hours the song of the practically accepted suitor. It was a good song,
and Thisbe seemed pleased, though I fancy she rather resented the note
of assurance which he imparted to his ballad.</p>

<p>Then Eug&egrave;ne came on. Bearing well in mind all the instruction of his
recent benefactress, he commenced at 11.45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> such a
masterpiece as has never before been heard in the bird world. His
consistency of period was masterly, his iteration superb and his even
monotony incomparable. Crake succeeded crake with dull regular
inevitability. So far as I know he carried his bat. He was still playing
strongly when I fell on a troubled sleep about 5.30....</p>

<p>The next day, walking through the field, I put up two birds which flew
away together. One was Thisbe. And the other? Well, not
Strong-i'-th'-lung. I stumbled across him a little later, dead without a
wound.</p>

<h3>SHOULD MILLIONAIRES READ HOMER?</h3>

<p>The recent discovery of a London millionaire, who not only lives in a
small suburban villa, where his wife dispenses with servants, goes to
bed at 7.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and rises at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, but reads
<span class="smcap">Homer</span> in the Greek, has caused a sensation.</p>

<p>His endeavours to prove to a doubting world the truth of a favourite
British adage is admirable; and his modest establishment only bears out
what the millionaires keep on telling us, that, owing to high taxation
and the abnormal cost of luxuries, they must really be reckoned as poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
men. But his study of <span class="smcap">Homer</span> provokes a difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Our representative, in interviewing a venerable sociologist on the
subject, was told that the study of Greek for millionaires is, within
proper limits, comparatively harmless, but that <span class="smcap">Homer</span> contains
the elements of danger.</p>

<p>"It is in <span class="smcap">Homer</span>'s apotheosis of heroism in human combat that
the peril lies," he said. "Having regard to the part played in the past
by financiers in the wars between civilised nations, the security of the
League of Nations will be threatened if the millionaires of to-day come
under the spell of that great poet, who, with all his excellent
qualities, directed his genius so persistently to the praise of
warfare."</p>

<p>One of the millionaire class was next approached, and was asked what he
thought of millionaires reading <span class="smcap">Homer</span>.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked. "Some millionaires are great readers. I am one
myself. There are not half-a-dozen of <span class="smcap">Oppenheim</span>'s I haven't
read; and I like <span class="smcap">Hall Caine</span>&mdash;and <span class="smcap">Ethel Dell</span>'s not bad.
Who is this <span class="smcap">Homer</span>? If he's any good I may as well order him."</p>

<p>"Well, <span class="smcap">Homer</span> was a poet, you know, a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've no use for poetry," said the millionaire.</p>

<p>"A Greek poet, who lived&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Greek. A <i>Greek</i>, did you say?" A shrewd look came into his eyes. "Some
of the cutest devils I know are Greeks." He pulled down a shirt-cuff and
took a diamond-studded pencil from his waistcoat pocket. "How do you
spell it? With an H?"</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<blockquote class="note">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</blockquote>

<p><i>Double Life</i> (<span class="smcap">Grant Richards</span>) is a story that unblushingly
bases its appeal on the love of almost everyone for a fairy-tale of good
fortune. The matter of it is to show how a lady amateur, wife of a
novelist, herself hardly knowing one end of a horse from the other,
might make forty thousand pounds in a year on the Turf, without even her
own husband so much as suspecting her activities. The thing isn't
likely, is indeed a fantasy of the wildest improbability; but, told with
the zest imparted to it here by Mr. <span class="smcap">Grant Richards</span>, it provides
first-rate fun. Some danger of monotony there was bound to be in what is
really a variation upon a single theme. Though the author cunningly
avoids this, I think it might justly be observed that he has made
<i>Olivia's</i> plunges almost too uniformly successful. But perhaps not;
after all, while you are handling fairy-gold, why be niggardly of it?
The heroine's introduction to horse-racing comes about through the
unconscious agency of her husband, who takes her with him on a visit to
Newmarket in search of local colour for a "sporting" novel. The
resulting situation reaches its climax in what is the best scene of the
book, when <i>Geoffrey</i>, returning from a race that he has visited alone,
but upon which <i>Olivia</i>, unknown to him, has risked thousands, recounts
its progress in the best manner of realistic fiction, wholly ignorant of
the true cause of what seems such flattering agitation in the listener.
Altogether a happy if not very subtle story which I am glad that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Grant Richards</span> could persuade himself to publish.</p>

<p>To write, as Mr. <span class="smcap">R.W. Chambers</span> has written, fifty-two novels,
many of them excellent and all readable, while still on the right side
of sixty, is an achievement of intelligent industry that entitles any
novelist, at the latter end, to take matters a little easily. <i>The
Moonlit Way</i> (<span class="smcap">Appleton</span>) has neither the imaginative qualities
of <i>The King in Yellow</i>, the humour of <i>In Search of the Unknown</i>, nor
the adventurous tang of <i>Ashes of Empire</i>, but it is a good live story
that will carry the reader's interest to the last page. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Chambers</span> is at his best when dealing with spies and secret
service agents and scheming chancellors and the other subterranean
apparatus of war and diplomacy; at his least interesting when depicting
affluent young America on its native heath of New York bricks and
mortar. <i>The Moonlit Way</i> deals with all these things and more. We are
whisked from the Bosphorus to the Welland Canal on the heels of
Germany's "War in the United States," and French Secret Service
officers, German saloon keepers and Sinn Fein revolutionaries jostle one
another for a place in our interest. The novel-reading public knows that
it is quite safe in buying any story by Mr. <span class="smcap">Chambers</span>, and, if
it does not expect too much of <i>The Moonlit Way</i>, it will not be
disappointed.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lately, volumes of individual memorial to dead youth seem to have become
less frequent. Perhaps there was a suggestion that the making of them,
or rather their publication for the eyes of strangers, was in danger of
being overdone. However this may be, I think that, quite apart from the
appeal of circumstance, there would always have been a welcome for such
a bright-natured book as one that Father <span class="smcap">Ronald Knox</span> has put
together, mostly from diaries and letters, about <i>Patrick Shaw-Stewart</i>
(<span class="smcap">Collins</span>). Eton and Balliol will agree that there could be no
biographer better fitted to record the life, as happy seemingly as it
was fated to be short, of one who combined success with popularity at
both these places, was caught by the War on the threshold of a wider
career, served his country with very notable distinction and was killed
in the winter of 1917. Though he met death in France, the most of
<span class="smcap">Shaw-Stewart's</span> war-service was on the Eastern front; in
particular he saw more than most soldiers of the whole Gallipoli
adventure, to which he went as a member of that amazing company&mdash;surely
the very flower of this country's war contribution&mdash;the <i>Hood</i> Battalion
of the R.N.V.R. Here he was the comrade of many of those whom England
has especially delighted to honour: <span class="smcap">Rupert Brooke</span>,
<span class="smcap">Denis-Browne</span>, <span class="smcap">Charles Lister</span> and others, all of whom
figure in these vivid and most attractive letters; from which also one
gathers an engaging picture of <span class="smcap">Shaw-Stewart</span> himself, a
generously admiring, humorous and entirely independent young Tory in a
band of brilliant revolutionaries. In fine a book (despite its theme of
promise sacrificed) full of laughter and a singularly charming
character-study of one who, in his biographer's phrase, was assuredly
"not one of the passengers of his generation."</p>

<h4>THE SPECIALIST.</h4>
<p><i>Eminent Botanist on scientific expedition</i>. "<span class="smcap">Dear me! Why didn't I
take up Zoology instead of Botany? This seems such an interesting
specimen.</span>"</p>

<hr />

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Ella Sykes</span>, after going with her brother and a camera on
his special mission to Kashgar during the earlier days of the War, has
detailed in charming fashion, under the title <i>Through Deserts and Oases
of Central Asia</i> (<span class="smcap">Macmillan</span>), their travels in lands still
almost unknown. Sir <span class="smcap">Percy Sykes</span> himself has added some chapters
on the history and customs of the district in order to allow himself the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
pleasure of referring affectionately to his hunting of the giant
sheep&mdash;the <i>Ovis poli</i>&mdash;of the Pamirs. Between them they have given me a
good deal of information, with a lot of really capital photographs,
about a country&mdash;Chinese Turkestan&mdash;that one may have just heard of
before, though it is impossible to be sure. Resisting a burning desire
to pass on newly-acquired learning to the first listener, I will be
content to say that a more readable volume of its kind has not come my
way for a long time, and incidentally the country itself seems
surprisingly desirable. For one thing it is free from the mosquitoes
that spoil so many books of travel, while the people are peaceful,
reasonably contented and not liable to jar on the reader's nerves, in
the time-honoured fashion, with spears and poisoned arrows. Even the
yaks, that one had supposed to be fearsome beasts, are mild benevolent
pacifists. The authors do not suggest that it is all Paradise, of
course, though for the Moslem there may be something of that sort in it.
"Praise be to Allah! I have four obedient wives, who spend all their
days in trying to please me," said a Kirghiz farmer to Sir
<span class="smcap">Percy</span>. But even Paradise may be a matter of taste.</p>

<hr />

<p>If <i>War in the Garden of Eden</i> (<span class="smcap">Murray</span>) cannot be numbered
among the books which must be read by a serious war-student it is in its
unassuming way very attractive. Captain <span class="smcap">Kermit Roosevelt</span> made
many friends while serving as a Captain with the Motor Machine-Gun Corps
in Mesopotamia, and here he reveals himself as a keen soldier and a
pleasant companion. In style he is perhaps a shade too jerky; his
frequent failure to make his connections gives one a sense of being in
the hands of a rather rambling guide. But the important points are that
he is an engaging rambler, and that he can describe his experiences both
of war and peace with so clear a simplicity that they can be easily
visualized. When the American Army arrived in France Captain
<span class="smcap">Roosevelt</span> naturally wished to join it, and his last chapter is
called "With the First Division in France and Germany." But for us the
main interest of his book lies in the work he did with the British in
Mesopotamia, and to thank him for this would seem to be an impertinence.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arnold Bennett's</span> <i>From the Log of the Velsa</i>
(<span class="smcap">Chatto</span>) deals with some vague period before the War (dates are
most carefully concealed), when the versatile author undertook certain
cruises up and down Dutch canals, the Baltic, French, Flemish and Danish
coasts and East Anglian estuaries with companions about whom he
preserves an equally mysterious silence. (Was it secret service, I
wonder?) A delightful book, produced with something like pre-war
attention to &aelig;sthetic appearance&mdash;a pleasant quarto with roomy pages
faithfully printed in a fair type. You ought to enjoy the owner's
evident enjoyment (he was never bored and therefore never boring), his
charmingly ingenuous pride of possession, his shrewd, humorous and
excessively didactic utterances about painters, pictures, architecture
and female beauty, his zeal for water-colour sketching and his
apparently profound contempt of other exponents of the craft. Nothing
could be less like (I thank Heaven) the ordinary yachtsman's
recollections of his travels, and I get an impression that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bennett</span> was not ill-pleased to leave most of the work and the
technical knowledge to his skipper.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
